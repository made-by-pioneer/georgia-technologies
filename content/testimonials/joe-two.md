text = "I have been a customer of Georgia Technologies for over 15 years, even when it was called South Georgia Computer Solutions. My practice was one of the first medical practices in Bulloch County to adopt electronic medical records in 2003. This required plenty of work and patience from the team at Georgia Technologies. They never backed down and worked overtime to keep us up and running. They also are able to adapt and stay on the leading edge of technology as it continuously changes on a moment’s notice. Georgia Technologies is a loyal group, friendly to work with, timely with their service, and willing to adapt to my company's needs as the future of medicine and healthcare evolves."
