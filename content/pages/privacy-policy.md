Georgia Technologies Corporation has a strong commitment to providing excellent service to all of our customers, including respecting their concerns about privacy. We understand that visitors to our website may have questions about whether and how this website collects and uses information. Accordingly, we have prepared this statement to inform you of the privacy principles that govern georgiatechnologies.com.

### **Browsing**
Visitors who browse this website do so on an anonymous basis. We have not configured this website to collect any information from your computer without your input. This means that, unless you voluntarily and knowingly provide us with information, we will not know your identity, your e-mail address, or any other information identifiable to you.

### **Information**
When we need to collect information from you, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For example, if you would like to make a service appointment, we will ask you for information such as your name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address to process your request. We will use your e-mail address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other information to contact you for help in processing the service request. After the information reaches Georgia Technologies Corporation, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind a firewall that is designed to block access from outside the Company.

We may also ask you to fill out an online customer survey, to obtain your suggestions or comments about your use of Georgia Technologies Corporation services, or for similar purposes. Providing this information is voluntary.

### **Internet Protocol (IP) Address**
An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When users request a page from our site, our servers log the user's current IP address. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. Thus, each user session is anonymous.

### **Georgia Technologies Corporation Use of Information**
We treat the information you provide to us as confidential information; it is, accordingly, subject to our company's security procedures and strict corporate policies regarding protection and use of confidential information. Because laws applicable to personal information vary by country, our business operations may put in place additional measures that vary depending on the applicable legal requirements. Information is generally processed and stored in the United States, in which data protection laws are not as comprehensive as in the European Union.

The survey and other such non-service request information is used only for the purpose for which the information was collected and is not used for direct marketing or shared with other companies. The personal information you provide to us for making a service request is made available to the applicable Company staff for the purpose of meeting your service request needs. If you cancel your service request, the information is stored for record-keeping purposes only. After completing your service request with Georgia Technologies Corporation, the information you provide may be used for direct marketing by Georgia Technologies Corporation, its subsidiaries and/or entities. Georgia Technologies Corporation may use the services of a third party mail house for the sole purpose of mailing materials.

### **Disclosure of Information and Opt-Out**
Georgia Technologies Corporation will not sell, trade, rent or release such information to entities outside of the Georgia Technologies Corporation family of companies for their use without your approval and giving you the opportunity to opt-out.

### **Cookies**
Our website makes only limited use of "cookie" technology. "Cookies" are strings of text that a website transmits to a user's computer. Cookies enable a website to keep track of a user's preferences and activities relating to that website. Our website creates a temporary cookie for each visit in order to facilitate your visit. Our cookies expire automatically after you leave our website. These cookies transmit no information about you or your computer back to Georgia Technologies Corporation. If you do not wish to receive these cookies, you may set your browser to reject the cookies (consult the instructions for your particular web browser on how to do this), although doing so may affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our website.

### **Links to Other Sites**
If you choose to leave this Georgia Technologies Corporation website via links to other non-Georgia Technologies Corporation websites, including those of advertisers, Georgia Technologies Corporation is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of those sites, nor is Georgia Technologies Corporation responsible for the cookies those sites might deposit on your hard drive.

### **Legal Issues**
This is a United States website and is subject to United States law. Georgia Technologies Corporation will disclose personal information without your permission when required by law, or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to investigate or protect against harmful activities to Georgia Technologies Corporation employees, or property (including this site), or to others.

### **Georgia Technologies Corporation Privacy Statement Changes**
In the future, we may need to change the privacy statement for georgiatechnologies.com. All changes will be made here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.

### **Conclusion**
Your privacy concerns are important to us. We hope this privacy statement has been helpful to you.
